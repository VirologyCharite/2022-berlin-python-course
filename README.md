## Berlin Python course 2022

Here is the code we wrote for the Python course.

### Todo

* `/tmp`
* Revise new words
* Additional data structures: `list`, `dict`
* Additional flow-of-control: `while`

### Terminology

* Indentation - whitespace at the start of a line of code
* string - a sequence of letters, like "hello"
* flow-of-control - Python keywords that determine the order in which the code is run
* markdown - a simple text file format for writing documentation like this. [More info here](https://www.markdownguide.org/).
* variable
* Iterator
* Pipe `|` (this is a shell metacharacter that causes the shell to send the output from the command on the left into the one on the right).
* IDE - Integrated Development Environment
* Interpreted language: A program that prints a prompt, reads your commands and executes them, one by one (as oppsed to "compiled" languages).
* REPL - Read evaluate prompt loop

### Important

* Indentation is important in Python!
* Read the Python error messages!

### Git & GitHub

* A bit more git
* diff, status, add, commit, push, pull

### Clusters

* ssh keys

### Python

* While loop
* functions
* classes
* Jupyter
* pandas (Leonie)

### Testing
