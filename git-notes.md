## Here are some high-level git notes

### Seeing status

`git status` lists known files with changes, unknown files, deletions,
renames, etc.

### Adding a file

Use `git add` to tell git that you want it to look after a file for you.

### Where are the remote copies?

```sh
$ git remote -v
origin	git@github.com:VirologyCharite/2022-berlin-python-course.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:VirologyCharite/2022-berlin-python-course.git (push)
```
